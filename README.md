# Reason for the project: 
    This project was built as a requirment to completing the fourth phase of our software engineering course at Flatiron school (class of 09/21). It's main aim is to apply and showcase the knowledge and skills we have acquired from the beginning of our bootcamp up to this point. These skills are demonstrated in our use of JavaScript and React functional components - this encompasses using React states to manage and manipulate dynamically changing events on the DOM, setting and using controlled forms and persisting data to a backend server. We also demostrated our skill of building a server side application to manage and communicate with our frontend using ruby on rails to manage a PostgreSQL database, define restful and non-restful routes, manage authentication and authorizations and validating data received from our frontend. Finally, we demostrated our knowledge and skill with CSS to design our web application, amongst others.

# Motivation for the project: 
    Over the last year or two, and with covid raging, online shopping has been one of the most vital industries that people have had no choice but to resort to. More importantly, some online shops have begun to offer almost instant delieveries on purchased products, further adding to the immense convenience online shopping provides.

    With this boost in the industry, my partner and i felt the need to apply our aquired knowledge to create an online store, specifically targeted to sell groceries. 

    We were greatly inspired by instacart and some instant grocery stores. Eventhough we are unable to match the functionality level and efficiency of instacart, we have replicated some of their basic features into our own custom application. 

  # Technologies Used

    For this poject, we incorporated the use of several technologies as were needed to achieve our functioning app.  Highlighted below are the main technologies that were used for this project:

      1. Ruby on rails
      2. PostgreSQL
      3. React
      4. HTML/JSX
      5. ActiveRecord
      6. CSS
      

# Project Description: 
   The instant grocery shop was designed to be able to sign up and new user, or sign in an existing user after which an authenticated user is shown the variety of grocery options that we have available in the store and a list of items that have been previously added to cart - if any. A signed in user can browse all products, browse by all categories available or search for a particular product. Each selected product can be added to the cart (after selecting a quantity). The carts display a list of all products that has been added and a total price for items in the cart. Cart items can be deleted if the user wishes to. Once chekout is clicked, stock value of all checked out products are adjusted on the database and the user is shown a page that promises that items will be delievered within a specific time frame.

# Learnings and Struggles:
   While this project looked simple at the start of it, we realised while building it that there were a lot of tiny details that went into every online store around that makes them function optimally and remain user friendly. We struggled with making this app as user friendly as possible and trying to make sure we caught all the little details that are required to make a basic and functional online shop. 

    Goals for Future Iterations:
    - A better flow for the authorization and authentication process
    - Ability of a user to edit their info afte signing up
    - An admin's ability to edit a product already added by stock, price, name or description
    - The ability to add the same item to cart more than once without it duplicating in the cart but adjusting the quantity in the cart
    - Fix some known bugs

    Known Bugs: 
    - if not logged in, navbar should not be display and navlinks should not work. They currently display and work if the exact link/path is typed in the browser

# Acknowledgments:
    This project was accomplished with the help of the many various resources provided by Flatiron Bootcamp, including our instructor who supported us whenever we hit a roadblock.
